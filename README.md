# The Well Played Game Web App

Hello! My name is Jacob Stephens, and I created this progressive web app to make more board and card games available to play digitally. The app is named after Bernard De Koven's book of the same name, [The Well Played Game](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/well-played-game), which helped shape my play philosophy.
