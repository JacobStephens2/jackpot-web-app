			<h1>AboutThe Game Well Playeds</h1>
			<p>Hi there! I, Jacob Stephens, created this site to make more board and card games available to play digitally. The site is named after Bernard De Koven's book of the same name. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/well-played-game"><i>The Game Well Played</i></a> has shaped my play philosophy. The ideas got me to stop bargaining with others for play time. Authentic play requires total volition.</p>
